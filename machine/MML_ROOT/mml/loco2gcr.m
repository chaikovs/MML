%  ALGORITHM
%  The LOCO matrix for a BPM converts the model BPM data to the
%  coordinate system of the actual BPM measurement.  The new BPM is   
%  is defined as the calibrated BPM data.  The middle layer applies
%  the coordinate conversion from the measured data to the model gcr2loco splits this matrix up
%  into a Gain, Crunch, and Roll term.
%
%  [Measured Coordinate System] = LOCO Matrix * [Model]                          (LOCO coordinate transform)
%  [Calibrated to Model Coordinate System] = inv(LOCO Matrix) * [Measured Data]  (Middle layer coordinate transform)
%
%  The middle layer stores the coordinate transform in terms of gain, crunch, and roll.
%  The gain terms are use in real2raw/raw2real (hence hw2physics/physics2hw) and the 
%  crunch and roll are used in programs like getpvmodel/setpvmodel.  That is, hw2physics/physics2hw
%  does not make a coordinate rotation, it just corrects the gain.
%
%  LOCO Matrix for the ith BPM  = [BPMData.HBPMGain(i)     BPMData.HBPMCoupling(i)
%                                  BPMData.VBPMCoupling(i) BPMData.VBPMGain(i)     ];
